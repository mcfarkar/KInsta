# Project 5 - *Build Instagram*

**KInsta** is a photo sharing app similar to Instagram but using Parse as its backend.

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] User can sign up to create a new account using Parse authentication.
- [X] User can log in and log out of his or her account.
- [X] The current signed in user is persisted across app restarts.
- [X] User can take a photo, add a caption, and post it to "Instagram".

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] User sees app icon in home screen and styled bottom navigation view
- [X] Style the feed to look like the real Instagram feed.
- [ ] After the user submits a new post, show an indeterminate progress bar while the post is being uploaded to Parse.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] After the user logs out, I thought the best experience was for them to leave the app, so upon logout, I close the app.

## Notes

It was a challenge for me to get the camera functionality up and running. I spent most of the hours on this assignment troubleshooting that.
